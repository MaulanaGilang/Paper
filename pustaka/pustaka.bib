This research paper gives a brief overview of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm and its subsequent advanced versions. Through the analysis, we reach many remarks and insightful results. The results show the differences and similarities among the YOLO versions and between YOLO and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The central insight is the YOLO algorithm improvement is still ongoing.This article briefly describes the development process of the YOLO algorithm, summarizes the methods of target recognition and feature selection, and provides literature support for the targeted picture news and feature extraction in the financial and other fields. Besides, this paper contributes a lot to YOLO and other object detection literature.}

  abstract  = {TypeScript is a quickly evolving superset of JavaScript with active development of new features. Our paper seeks to understand how quickly these features are adopted by the developer community. Existing work in JavaScript shows the adoption of dynamic language features can be a major hindrance to static analysis. As TypeScript evolves the addition of features makes the underlying standard more and more difficult to keep up with. In our work we present an analysis of 454 open source TypeScript repositories and study the adoption of 13 language features over the past three years. We show that while new versions of the TypeScript compiler are aggressively adopted by the community, the same cannot be said for language features. While some experience strong growth others are rarely adopted by projects. Our work serves as a starting point for future study of the adoption of features in TypeScript. We also release our analysis and data gathering software as open source in the hope it helps the programming languages community.},
